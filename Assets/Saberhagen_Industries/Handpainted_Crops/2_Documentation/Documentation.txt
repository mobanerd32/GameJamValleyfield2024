Documentation for Handpainted Crops

The package contains six different crops with six growing stages each and are inteded for 
some sort of growing overtime. The package contains only textures and models and basic shaders.

To achieve realtime growing one coulds make a procedural scaling animation before swapping the mesh out
and add a particle effect to cover up the sudden switch.

For growing when the days transition a simple model swap works of course!

For spawning the plots or crops in you can activate the "Fade" boolean parameter of the Basic Material and change the
surface type to Transparent, then for spawning in start with a "Fade Amount" parameter of 1 and animate it down
to 0!

For making the plots wet you could activate the "HSL" boolean parameter of the Basic Material and animate the "Lightness"
parameter down to 0.7!

Have fun growing and harvesting!
